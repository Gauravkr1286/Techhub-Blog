TechHub-Blog A complete blog website created with JAMstack. 
TechHub-blog is a complete tech blog website. Here we will see three post types: blogs, categories, and authors. 
We will create relations between these three post types. So that we can create a blog post with a category and an author. Also we will make a search feature where we can search against all these three post types. To create this website we will use JAMstack. We will use Gatsby.js for the frontend and Sanity.io for the headless CMS. And to source our content we will use graphql.
